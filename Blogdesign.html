            Islam, Kazi Nazrul (1899-1976) national poet of Bangladesh, called
            the 'rebel poet' for his brave resistance to all forms of
            repression. His poetry, with its vibrant rhythms and iconoclastic
            themes, forms a striking contrast to rabindranath tagore's poetry.
            Though he had great regard and admiration for the older poets and
            writers, he did not imitate any poet or writer, even not
            Rabindranath, though it was a fashion of the day.

          <div>
            Nazrul used subjects and vocabulary never used in Bangla poetry
            before.He became immensely popular for portraying in his poems
            contemporary political and social phenomenon. Some fundamental
            conflicts of human civilisation also formed the themes of his poems.
            Singularly non-communal, Nazrul drew upon his mixed Hindu and Muslim
            cultural traditions. He used Sanskrit and Arabic metres as easily as
            he did traditional Bangla ones. He referred to Persian archetypes
            with as much ease as he did ancient Hindu ones.
